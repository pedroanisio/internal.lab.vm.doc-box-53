
## Notes
The documentation system follows a hierarchical structure with reversed hierarchy
naming (internal.lab.vm.{vm-name}) to maintain consistency and traceability across
all documentation sets. Each VM has its own documentation container, with a
planned central entry point to connect all documentation instances.
